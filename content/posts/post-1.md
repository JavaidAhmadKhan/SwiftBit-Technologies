Choosing the "best" tech stack for building web applications with React.js depends on various factors, including the specific requirements of your project, your team's expertise, and the goals you want to achieve. However, I can suggest a commonly used and robust tech stack for React.js development:

1. **React.js**: The core library for building user interfaces. React allows you to create reusable UI components and manage the state of your application efficiently.

2. **Redux (Optional)**: Redux is a predictable state container that can be particularly useful for managing the state of larger applications. It helps maintain a single source of truth for the application state.

3. **React Router**: For handling navigation in your single-page applications. React Router enables you to define routes and navigate between different views in your React application.

4. **Webpack**: A module bundler that helps bundle your JavaScript, CSS, and other assets. Webpack is widely used in the React community to manage project dependencies and optimize code for production.

5. **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler that allows you to use the latest ECMAScript features in your code and ensures compatibility with different browsers.

6. **Axios or Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests from your React application to interact with a server or API. Axios is a popular library for handling HTTP requests, but you can also use the built-in Fetch API.

7. **ESLint and Prettier**: These tools help maintain code quality and enforce coding standards. ESLint identifies and fixes common coding issues, while Prettier ensures consistent code formatting.

8. **Jest and React Testing Library**: For writing unit tests and integration tests for your React components. Jest is a testing framework, and React Testing Library provides utilities for testing React components in a user-centric way.

9. **CSS-in-JS or Stylesheet Preprocessors**: Choose a styling approach based on your preference and project requirements. Options include using plain CSS, CSS modules, Styled Components, or other CSS-in-JS solutions.

10. **Material-UI or Ant Design (Optional)**: If you want a pre-built component library for your project, Material-UI and Ant Design are popular choices. They provide a set of well-designed, customizable components that can save development time.

Remember that the "best" tech stack may vary depending on your specific needs. Always consider factors such as project complexity, scalability, team expertise, and community support when making technology decisions.
