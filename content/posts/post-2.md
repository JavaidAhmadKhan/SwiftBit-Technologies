Choosing the best tech stack for building mobile applications with ReactJS depends on various factors such as project requirements, team expertise, and specific use cases. However, as of my last knowledge update in January 2022, some popular and widely used tech stacks for ReactJS mobile app development include:

1. **React Native:** React Native is a framework developed by Facebook that allows you to build mobile applications using React and JavaScript. It provides a way to write code once and run it on both iOS and Android platforms, making it a popular choice for cross-platform mobile development.

2. **Expo:** Expo is a set of tools and services built around React Native that simplifies the development process. It includes a set of pre-built components and libraries, making it easier to get started with React Native development. Expo is often chosen for projects where rapid development and prototyping are crucial.

3. **TypeScript:** TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing to the language. Many React developers prefer using TypeScript for better code quality, editor support, and improved collaboration between team members.

4. **Redux or MobX for State Management:** React itself doesn't prescribe a specific state management solution, but for larger applications, you might want to consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX to handle complex state logic.

5. **GraphQL:** GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows you to request only the data you need. Integrating GraphQL into your React Native application can lead to more efficient data fetching and improved performance.

6. **Axios or Fetch for API calls:** To interact with APIs, you can use libraries like Axios or the built-in `fetch` API.

7. **Jest and React Testing Library for Testing:** Writing tests is crucial for maintaining the quality of your application. Jest is a popular testing framework, and React Testing Library is often used for testing React components.

8. **React Navigation:** For navigation in React Native applications, React Navigation is a widely used library that provides a simple and customizable way to navigate between screens.

Remember that the technology landscape evolves, and new tools and libraries may have emerged since my last update. Always check for the latest recommendations and community preferences when starting a new project. Additionally, consider the specific requirements and constraints of your project to make informed decisions about your tech stack.
