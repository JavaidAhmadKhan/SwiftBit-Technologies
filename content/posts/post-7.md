NFT stands for "Non-Fungible Token." It is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content using blockchain technology. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

NFTs are typically used to represent digital or digitized assets, including art, music, videos, virtual real estate, and other digital content. Each NFT is stored on a blockchain, which is a decentralized and secure digital ledger. The blockchain verifies and records ownership, ensuring that the NFT cannot be duplicated or tampered with.

One key feature of NFTs is their ability to include smart contracts, which can define specific rules and conditions for the use and transfer of the digital asset. This allows creators to receive royalties automatically when their NFTs are resold, providing ongoing compensation for their work.

NFTs gained significant attention and popularity in the art world, allowing digital artists to monetize their work and giving collectors a new way to own and trade digital assets. However, the NFT space is diverse, and its applications extend beyond art to various digital and virtual goods.
